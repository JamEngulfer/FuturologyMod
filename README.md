Power *We will use MJ, and RC Steam!
*Solar Power
*Hydro Power: Will only work if flowing water is above it. An array of them is needed to make reasonable power.
*Nuclear Power(Uranium)- Will produce a block that would explode the machine if left in the machine, and will damage the player while it's in the inventory, unless the player is wearing certain armor. The block needs to be stored underground, or surrounded by blocks, and if it is in contact with air for a certain time, will explode!
*Thorium Power Gen(Google it): Requested specifically by a user. Basically Nuclear gen without as much waste, or not at all.
*Wind Power: This would be like most wind powergen.
*Thermal Generation: Obviously produced power via heat(like in GT)
Armor We will use the real-life properties of Graphene and Tungsten Carbide to make armor. Graphene is a revolutionary material that is 200x stronger than steel, with a great energy conductivity, so we could use this to make advanced armor with electrical tools.
Tungsten carbide will be an early game armor. Tungsten Carbide is used to make other metals stronger, so it could be applied to Iron Armor(or Steel, if RailCraft is present, which it must be for the steam)
Tools *EarlyGame Tools: *Graphene / Carbide Tools(Manual) *Automatic Tools(Easy Recipe, Charges with MJ, via any Power Generator, can also be charged via armor(Graphene))
*MidGame: *Advanced Automatic Tools: Larger MJ Storage, fatser, enchantable(perhaps)
*EndGame: *Item Similar to a Vajra(I know it's not GT, but it's EU)
More Soon!
